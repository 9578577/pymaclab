The program can be installed from source by running the command:

sudo -H python setup.py install 

Before running this command make sure the following additional packages are installed (for example in Debian/Ubuntu/Mint using the following commands):

sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
sudo apt-get install python-tk

In order for Numpy and Scipy to function and install normally (as well as for other routines which are compiled from source in C and Fortran), it would be good to have Lapack libraries and developement files installed, for example by issuing the following command before installing the main program:

sudo-apt-get install liblapack-dev
